# Statistical Analysis of factors influencing life expectancy
There have been studies on factors that affect life expectancy like gender, ethnicity, etc., but
there hasnâ€™t been much study done on factors like immunization, which can matter a lot as there are countries where the awareness for immunization is less which may lead to lower life
expectancy. Other factors can also play a role like the GDP of that country, etc.
In this project, we do a study that puts focus on factors like immunization, social, economic and other health related factors and see if there is any correlation among these factors and predict what can be the life expectancy of an individual who is from a particular country with all the above mentioned factors provided.

### Data Source:
For this kind of study, accuracy of information is a must. The dataset related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website
and its corresponding economic data were collected from the United Nation website. The sample is globally representative. Among all categories of health-related factors, only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. For example, we have immunization related factors , mortality factors, economic and social factors.
